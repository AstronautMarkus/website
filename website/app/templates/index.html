                    <h3>DevOps Tools</h3>

                    <p>
                      I've always thought that DevOps was like the "dark side" for system administrators, but rather than trying to eliminate it,
                      it complements their work. In my experience, tools like <strong>Docker</strong> have been
                      fundamental for creating consistent development and production environments, especially in microservices architectures.
                      Additionally, I've used CI/CD tools like <strong>Jenkins</strong> and <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to automate build and
                      deployment processes, which has significantly improved the efficiency and quality of my projects. In summary, although DevOps
                      may seem intimidating at first, it's an essential part of modern development and has been a valuable addition to my skillset
                      as a developer and system administrator.
                        <br><br>
                        But always, Always, I prefer to write my own <strong>bash scripts</strong> to automate tasks, I don't like to depend on <strong>third party tools</strong>, but when the project is big and complex, I have to use them.
                        <br><br>
                        You'll never see me using <strong>cPanel</strong>, btw, I fucking hate <strong>cPanel</strong>, it's a piece of ... nah. I only don't like programs that make things easy for you.
